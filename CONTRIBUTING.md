## New Themes

To contribute a new theme, please do the following:

- Submit a pull request with the title `Theme Submission: <theme name>`

### README Template

```md
# theme_name 

- Theme Source: *Reference to information about the theme elsewhere. Required if you're submitting a theme based on a palette you didn't create.*
- Owner(s): *Your GitHub username(s). Used to auto-approve submitted theme update PRs. This refers to the theme submission owner, NOT the palette/name/copyright/etc. owner*
- Contributor(s): *GitHub username(s) of anybody who has submitted an update, but isn't an original author (if any)*

If you wish to submit a theme that can freely have suggestions submitted by others, please put `- Owner: Community` with yourself as a contributor

## Theme Updates

### Community-owned Themes

Really like one of the defaults but find that it could use another category?  
Think one of the existing categories could use a few more filetypes?  
Have some unreasonably strong opinions on hex colors?  

Submit a PR! I'd love your help making the defaults even better for everyone!

### User-owned Themes

- Are you an existing theme author?
  - **Yes:** Make whatever changes you want and submit a PR! I'll almost certainly pass it through without issue.
  - **No:** Feel free to make suggestions and submit a PR, but you must add a theme owner as a required reviewer.
