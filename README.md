# stylish

Welcome to `stylish`, a simple and intuitive way to create `dircolors`-compatible config files in a way that actually makes sense! 

No more memorizing xterm-color codes, no more forgetting whether '01' corresponds to `bold` or `underline`, and certainly no more need to do all of this without a realtime preview!

## Roadmap

- truecolor / hex code support
- palettes

## Installation

### Github Releases

- Go to the `Releases` tab
- Download the latest binary for your OS
- Place it on your PATH and ensure it is executable

### Homebrew

- Ensure you have `brew` installed
- Run the following:
```sh
brew tap daltonsw/packages
brew install stylish
```
